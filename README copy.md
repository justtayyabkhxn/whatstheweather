#### Description

This Weather App allows users to check the current weather conditions of any location by entering the city name. The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updates the display with weather information such as temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed. It also features a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes for user preference.

#### Approach and Technologies Used

The Weather App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of the approach and technologies used:

- **HTML**:language used for structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: language used for designing the layout and appearance of the app.
- **JavaScript**: language used for adding interactivity and fetching weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: External API used to retrieve current weather data based on user input.
- **Boxicons**: Icon library used for displaying icons such as refresh, search, moon, water, and wind.

The application follows a client-side approach, where the weather data is fetched asynchronously from the API upon user interaction (search button click). The fetched data is then processed and displayed dynamically on the webpage. The app also continuously updates the current date and time using JavaScript's setInterval function.

Enjoy checking the weather with this simple and intuitive Weather App!
